flag:
  file: server/flag.txt

containers:
  main:
    build: server
    ports:
      - 5000

  main:
    - target: 5000
      http: reader

  - kind: zip
    spec:
      as: server.zip
      exclude:
        - server/flag.txt
      files:
        - server
      additional:
        - path: server/flag.txt
