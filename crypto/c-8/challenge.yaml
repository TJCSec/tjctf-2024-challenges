  I found these files on sciencequis hard drive... 
  Can you help me decrypt it? I'm p sure he's writing a fanfic about me
  he only knows the affine cipher.
  note; you need to decrypt all the files w/ affine first, and then you can run dec.py
  
  hint; (also in the discord), affine modulus n = 18446744073709551629

provide:
  - ./bin/enc/enc.py
  - ./bin/enc/dec.py
  - ./bin/enc/re_plaus.py
  - ./bin/enc/plausibly.deniable
